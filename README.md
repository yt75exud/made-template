# Methods of Advanced Data Engineering Template Project

## Correlation between monthly figures for traffic accidents and weather figures in MÃ¼nster region.

## Overview

This project seeks to explore the correlation between accident and weather data in Munich, utilizing publicly available datasets from the Munich statistical office to examine this relationship over time. The data pipeline, located in the data folder, facilitates the loading, processing, and storage of data from the internet into a database. Additional project details, including the utilized datasources, can be found in the project folder. The comprehensive findings derived from the processed data are presented in the report.ipynb.

This repository has been created as part of my enrollment in the Advanced Methods of Software Engineering course offered by the Professorship of Open-Source Software at FAU. The assignment involved developing a Data Engineering Project that utilizes a minimum of two publicly available datasources, processing them through an automated datapipeline, and presenting key findings from the outcomes.
